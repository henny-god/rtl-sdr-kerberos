rtl-sdr-kerberos
turns your Realtek RTL2832 based DVB dongle into a SDR receiver
======================================================================

This specific branch adds features that are available in Tamas Peto's
demo project to the kerberossdr driver. Currently, those are just
sample-sync and iq calibration. It's intended to be used for more
modular/customized setups that don't want to run some of the overhead
in that project.
